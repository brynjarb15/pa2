The port number is gotten from a given parameter and a socket is created and bind. A TCP connection is accepted 
and a connfd is created as a handle dedicated to the connection. When a request is gotten the message is split up 
and put into an array. That array is then used to collect single information from the request. 

A html page is created that holds different things for GET POST and HEAD requests.

The GET request displays the URL of the requested page, the IP address and port number of the requestion client.

The content for the POST request is the URL of the requested page, the IP address and port number of the requesting 
client and the data in the body of the POST request. 

the content for the HEAD request is only the header of the requested page.

Depending on wich request is currently being processed the information for that request is then put together into a 
single string, the information is in the middle of the body of the html code. That whole string is then sent and the 
memory taken is then released again.

For each request, a single line is printed into a log file. The line has the format:
timestamp : <client ip>:<client port> <request method> <requested URL> : <response code>

Depending on the value of the connection header field and the time of inactivity of sending requests, the connection is 
either persitent or closed. If the value is closed, the time of inactivity is 30 seconds or we recieve HTTP/1.0 without a 
keep-alive connection then the connections will be closed but open for a new connection. If none of that applies then the 
connection will be persistent.
